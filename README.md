# Architecture

Computers are made up of:
* Processor
* Random Access Memory (RAM)
* Input/s (microphone, HDD, keyboard, mouse, etc)
* Output/s (screen, HDD, speaker, etc)

### Processor

The processor is the logical component component of a computer. It is responsible for completing instructions given to it by the programmer. It reads input, processes it according to its instructions and outputs the changed input.

The processor uses the RAM to store all of its temporary values, such as variables and constants.

### RAM

RAM is responsible for storing all the data of programs that are running. It is made up of two parts, the stack and the heap.

The stack is the part of the RAM responsible for thread execution. It manages the functions running (more about this later). The stack is controlled and allocated by the operating system of the computer.

The heap is the part of the RAM that is available for dynamic allocation. The heap allows you to create variables without explicitly specifying them in code. Your program can use the heap to create variables on the fly.
